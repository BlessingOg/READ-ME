# READ-ME

Hi, my name is Blessing! I’m a Computer Science major at The University of Texas at Dallas with a passion for building tech that helps people and makes a real impact.

During the school year, I work as a Peer Advisor, where I support first-year Computer Science students — from helping them navigate coursework to planning events and creating a strong sense of community. I love mentoring others and making sure no one feels alone in their CS journey.

I’ve also interned as a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase, where I worked on real development projects that challenged me to grow technically and collaborate with others in fast-paced environments. My academic background, combined with past roles, including a research internship at Carnegie Mellon, has helped me build a solid foundation in problem-solving, teamwork, and user-centered design.
